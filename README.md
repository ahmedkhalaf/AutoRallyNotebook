## Review MPC section from my Self-Driving car nanodegree material

https://www.udacity.com/self-driving-car

Notes: MPC controls both acceleration and steering based on Waypoints from traj. planning node.

Code: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project

## Self-study material references:

### Melanie Zeilinger: "Learning-based Model Predictive Control - Towards Safe Learning in Control"

Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics (IPAM) - Intersections between Control, Learning and Optimization 2020

Notes:
* very interesting lecture, TODO: what's GP and QP?
* learning part used for parameters could be Deep-learning or similar
* physics first-principles part for control and constraints
* MPC controller gets contraints (hard) from evnironment --> safety

# Feb, 10

## Subteam event: meeting with J. Knaup
- Code is just to understand MPC
- Actual MPC for us will be in C++ ROS node for high-level planning .. low level controllers for motors ..etc are out of scope 
- NN used for system identification
- TODO: Run simulation and inform Jacob when ready

# Feb, 14

- Gazebo crashes in VMware with GPU HW acceleration!
- TODO: check how to run GUI applications, Gazebo and RQT seem to be required
- container is faster but several configuration issues to get GPU accelration for MMPI controller
- TODO: try VM on more powerful computer

# Feb, 15

## Team event: bi-weekly team meeting

TODO: review papers and send them to Jacob for discussion

# Feb, 19

New info from Jacob:

- For what we are doing, you donâ€™t need to run Gazebo or MPPI
- Code not available in public repo (Not the MPPI Controller)
- New code repos provided as archives (snapshot from working stuff on Jacob's side)
- TODO: build Autorally-private in same catkin workspace with Autorally repo

# Feb 20

- Building private code fails
- Error CMAKE_CUDA_DEVICE_LINK_EXECUTABLE --> What do we need GPU for?
TODO:
* Check with Jacob reg. dependencies, compiler version ..etc

# Feb, 23

Managed to run the code from Jacob, LTVMPC results look really sad

# Feb, 26

## Subteam event: meeting with Jacob

Notes:
- No need to push to repo for now (strange!)
- Target speed 5m/s doesn't work. Set target speed 2.5m/s
- TODO: Join slack channel
- TODO: Provide several runs with target speed 2.5m/s to Jacob
- Not sure why trajectory isn't optimal even if target speed is low and weight of error in y = 0? TODO: Investigate 
- Discussed proposals for progress toward time-optimal:
  1. Tracking a certain target speed isn't important - Agreed
  2. Tracking distance from center lane isn't important - Agreed
  3. Change model into time-independent model (like [Verschueren, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2014.7039771) ) - Jacob not sure it's a good idea, seems too much work and we linearize anyway
  4. I proposed trying to add change parameters/cost function to memics the same effect (emphasis on distance traveled)

Results are much better with speed set point 2.5m/s

![run_vel2.5_2](images/run_vel2.5_2.png)
![run_vel2.5_3](images/run_vel2.5_3.png)


# Mar, 1

## Team event: bi-weekly team meeting
- TODO: maintain environment/dependencies installation steps in prep_env.sh
- Feedback from J. Knaup, performance baseline with 5m/s is better than my screenshots, controller might be running slow (simulation and code run in realtime not sim time)
![baseline from J. Knaup](images/run_vel5.0_jacob.png)

# Mar, 2

- TODO: Deep dive into the implementation
- Seems we're using CVXGEN, apply for educational license

# Mar, 4

- Changing problem formulation in CVXGEN to maximize travel on the track, still unstable results despite contraint on lateral position to be within track width.
- Seems the scope of work will go beyond parameter tuning
- TODO: review MPC and Optimization material
- TODO: modify speed based on curvature? (increase in straight sections, decrease in acute curved sections)
- TODO: check where targets are coming from to the solver?

# Mar, 12

Notes on expirement with agressive target S

* Adding target on state variable (s) improves results are getting better (faster), but still unstable
* Target is calculated with curvature speed modifier (TODO: not sure this is a good idea, can be confusing to the solver?)
* Increasing the weight of target S improves speed as expected (since S is calculated with more agressive speed in straight sections?)

* TODO: review with Jacob what might be the reason
* TODO: expirement with extreme cases (target speed very low/high, on straight/acute section ..etc) in order to identify root cause
* TODO: include results and explaination in slides for Monday meeting.

# Mar, 13

- TODO: expirement with multishot rather than single-shot

# Mar, 15

## Team event: bi-weekly team meeting
- presented LTVMPC_CW.pptx, no major comments
- TODO: Prof. asked for better visualization (track top-view)

# Mar, 16

Notes from expirements:

- Adding target on difference of initial and terminal state variable (s) might be better than a single target for the whole horizon, TODO try it?
- Setting terminal cost to zero improves the unstable/strange results
- From [J. Mattingley, Y. Wang and S. Boyd, 2010](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/rhc_aut_gen_solvers.pdf) Receding Horizon Control AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF HIGH-SPEED SOLVERS:
> For some problems, stability guarantees can be obtained by adding specific terminal costs and constraints. *Terminal costs and constraints also allow simpler, shorterhorizon controllers to approximate the behavior of controllers with longer horizons.*
- TODO: discuss how important is it with Jacob.

# Mar, 17

## Subteam event: meeting with Jacob
- TODO: push changes to autorally private repo, Nolan shall provide access

# Mar, 20

Updated CVXGEN to multishot and cost term for dS = quad((Sterminal_target - Sinitial_target) - (Sterminal - Sinitial))

Notes from simulation expirements with multi-shot

* Speed isn't greatly improved compared to baseline but faster than target S and better handling and stays in track than both
* Simulation with with multi-shot + dS term doesn't yield faster result, TODO: additional tuning needed?
* TODO: make all options (weights for State variables, Terminal stats, dS ..etc) available as configuration parameters for better expirementation

Simulation Result multishot:

# Mar, 29

## Team event: bi-weekly team meeting
- presented LTVMPC_CW2.pptx, no major comments
- J. Knaup commented: too wiggly, TODO: meet to discuss what's causing that
- TODO: provide the modifications directly, for some reason it's not possible to get write access

# Apr, 1

Provided snapshot of code, simulation data: param configuration and results

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xYH4obNJ-CdsZgzQLf75BU93-yluHrvm/view?usp=sharing

# Apr, 12

Seems execution time impacts the output greatly, TODO: rebuild envirnoment on a Core-i7 machine with clean ubuntu install to confirm.

Jacob created a private repo:
https://github.gatech.edu/jknaup3/autorally_private-ahmed

TODO: clone and sync with this one

# Apr, 14

## Subteam event: meeting with Jacob
- Jacob: curvature map is not the right one for CCRF
- TODO: calculate curvature instead of using the map

# Apr, 19

- TODO: Use Heron's formula, calculate curvature for each S from 3 points (actual point one before and one after)
- K = 4 * Area / ABC where A,B,C are the triangle side lengths
- Ref. from Jacob for X,Y -> S,n calculations : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8317775

# Apr, 20

- Curvature calculation will not be smooth using raw data
- TODO: Try another optimization based curve fitting approach with segments with min of 3 points and 5m or 4m?

Much better results!

CCRF map ~ 5m sections:

![CCRF m~ ap 5m sections:CCRF map 5m sections](images/CCRF_curv_map.png)

- TODO: Generate optimal (min curvature, min time ..etc) racelines offline and use as target
- TODO: Try this code, looks good but doesn't seem to be time-optimal

* Scope of work expanded significantly compared to original goal, but was great learning experience
* Main goal achieved: LTVMPC controller can achieve much faster lap times now, with improved options for expirementation and tuning
* Further work can make use of offline raceline optimzation
